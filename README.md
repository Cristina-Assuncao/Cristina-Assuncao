## Cristina Assuncao

Enthusiastic aspiring Computer Scientist with a background in art.

Since discovering my passion for coding when I self-taught how to design a website to showcase my artwork, I have been upskilling with eagerness, fascination, and curiosity. My interest in the field started during lockdown, and I have since acquired fundamental skills in back-end, data analysis, and machine learning. I graduated from the highly competitive Skills Bootcamp delivered by HyperionDev in partnership with Imperial College London in 2023 and am currently enrolled in HarvardX's Data Science Professional Certificate.
I look forward to further developing my skill set and pursuing a career in the tech industry.

I am currently enrolled in HarvardX's Data Science Professional Certificate.
